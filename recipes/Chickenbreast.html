        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>A chicken breast dish is a versatile and healthy meal option made using boneless, skinless chicken breast, which is lean, high in protein, and quick to cook. It can be grilled, baked, pan-seared, or cooked in sauces to suit different tastes. Popular versions include grilled chicken breast with herbs, baked chicken with garlic and butter, or creamy mushroom chicken. The mild flavor of chicken breast makes it easy to pair with vegetables, rice, pasta, or salads, making it a favorite for both everyday meals and special occasions.</p>
